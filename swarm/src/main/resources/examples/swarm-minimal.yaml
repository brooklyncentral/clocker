description: |
  Uses the default settings for configuring the Swarm, apart from the initial
  size of the cluster of Docker Engine nodes.

  Deploys on AWS using only the default Swarm entity configuration. Requires
  a security group to be deined in the AWS region or VPC, which should be
  set in the 'templateOptions' of the location, as seen below. The VMs
  must also have iptables disabled, which is accomplished by setting the
  'stopIptables' configuration key to 'true' on the Swarm entity.
