Clocker
====

Entities and sample code to allow Brooklyn to deploy and manage a Docker cloud infrastructure.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the `clocker.sh` script. This will launch Brooklyn and the Clocker
console UI, with persistence and other useful default settings configured. You can also
use the `brooklyn.sh` script with the `clocker` command and alternative options.

    % ./bin/clocker.sh
    % ./bin/brooklyn.sh clocker

The Clocker catalog contains a blueprint for a Docker Cloud and some example
applications. To start a Docker Cloud using the provided `docker-cloud.yaml` blueprint
and its default options, use the following command:

    % ./bin/clocker.sh jclouds:aws-ec2:us-east-1

Other blueprints are provided in the `blueprints` directory to illustrate different
application configuration mechanisms.

## More Information

More details are available at the Clocker website and GitHub repository.
