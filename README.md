Clocker
=======

Clocker contains [Brooklyn](http://brooklyn.io/) entities, locations and examples that create a [Docker](http://docker.io) cloud infrastructure.

## Getting started

This project requires a Docker instance that Brooklyn will use as a target location when deploying application
blueprints.

You can use Brooklyn to install Docker onto a single existing machine, or create a Docker based cloud infrastructure on
your favourite cloud provider or on a private cloud using any of the jclouds supported APIs.

To install a Docker cloud infrastucture using the Clocker Brooklyn entities, there is an example blueprint at
[DockerCloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/master/examples/src/main/java/brooklyn/clocker/example/DockerCloud.java)
or [docker-cloud.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brooklyncentral/clocker/master/examples/src/main/assembly/files/blueprints/docker-cloud.yaml).

### Using the latest Clocker release

You can build a *Docker Cloud Infrastructure* running these commands:
```Bash
    % wget --no-check-certificate --quiet \
      -O brooklyn-clocker-examples-0.4.0-dist.tar.gz https://git.io/WOhfyw
    % tar zxf brooklyn-clocker-examples-0.4.0-dist.tar.gz
    % cd brooklyn-clocker-examples-0.4.0
    % ./clocker.sh launch --cloud --location <location>
```
Where `<location>` can be e.g. `jclouds:softlayer`, or a named location or a fixed IP e.g. `byon:(hosts="1.2.3.4")`.
Those simple steps will give you a running docker instance on your favourite cloud.

**Important**: Please be sure that the location allows incoming connections on TCP ports *2375-2376* (the Docker daemon) and in
the range *49000-49900* used by Docker to map container ports onto ports on the hosts public IP address. If you create a
security group on AWS called _docker_ this will be used automatically by the application. If the location you use is
configured to use a specific image then please ensure that that image uses Ubuntu for its operating system.

For more information on setting up locations, see the _Setting up Locations_ section of
[Brooklyn Getting Started](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/quickstart/index.html), and the "Off-the-shelf
Locations" section of [Brooklyn Common Usage](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/defining-applications/common-usage.html).

Once the `DockerCloud`  application has started, a new location named `my-docker-cloud` will be
available in the Locations drop-down list when adding new applications. Simply start a new application in this location
and it will use Docker containers instead of virtual machines.

### Building from source

Build and run the examples as follows:

```Bash
    % git clone https://github.com/brooklyncentral/clocker.git
    % cd clocker
    % mvn clean install
    % cd examples
    % mvn assembly:single

    % cd target
    % tar zxf brooklyn-clocker-examples-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT-dist.tar.gz
    % cd brooklyn-clocker-examples-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT
    % ./clocker.sh launch --cloud --location <location>
```
